1) Create 3 Microservices – OrderService, StockService, and EmailService:- 
Objective:
Design and implement an event-driven microservices architecture for order processing using RabbitMQ as the message broker.

Technical Design:

OrderService: Accepts order requests and produces events.

StockService: Listens for order events and validates stock availability.

EmailService: Sends email notifications upon order placement or failure.

Professional Note:
Follows the Separation of Concerns principle, enabling independent scalability and resilience per service.

2) Import and Setup 3 Microservices in IntelliJ IDEA:- 
Objective:
Enable seamless parallel development and debugging by importing all services into a single IDE workspace.

Steps Taken:

Created three individual Spring Boot projects with Maven.

Added dependencies: spring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter-amqp, and spring-boot-devtools.

Imported all projects as Maven modules in IntelliJ IDEA.

Configured each project with its own application.properties and port.

Interview Tip:
Emphasize modular project setup and independent service lifecycles for real-world maintainability.

3) OrderService Microservice – Configure RabbitMQ Step by Step:- 
Objective:
Establish communication between OrderService and RabbitMQ.

Implementation Steps:

Set RabbitMQ configuration in application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.rabbitmq.host=localhost
spring.rabbitmq.port=5672
spring.rabbitmq.username=guest
spring.rabbitmq.password=guest
Defined beans for:

DirectExchange

Queue (e.g., order.queue)

Binding (linking queue to exchange with routing key)

Professional Insight:
Demonstrates deep understanding of broker configuration and message routing using Spring AMQP.

4) OrderService Microservice – Create RabbitMQ Producer:- 
Objective:
Develop a producer component to publish order messages to RabbitMQ.

Implementation:

Used RabbitTemplate to send messages.

Created a producer class OrderEventProducer with method:

java
Copy
Edit
rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend(exchange, routingKey, message);
Best Practice:
Keeps message publishing logic decoupled from controller, enabling easier testing and refactoring.

5) OrderService Microservice – Create REST API to Send Message:- 
Objective:
Expose an endpoint to receive client orders and trigger RabbitMQ events.

Steps:

Created a @RestController with POST endpoint /api/orders.

Accepted JSON Order object and passed it to the producer.

Validated flow using Postman.

Technical Insight:
Illustrates synchronous REST interface translating to asynchronous messaging, enabling system decoupling.

6) StockService Microservice – Configure RabbitMQ:- 
Objective:
Set up StockService to consume messages from the order.queue.

Configuration:

Same RabbitMQ host and port settings as OrderService.

Defined beans for Queue, Exchange, and Binding.

Key Point:
Each consumer should be independently configurable and reusable.

7) StockService Microservice – Create RabbitMQ Consumer:- 
Objective:
Consume and process order events for stock validation.

Steps Taken:

Annotated method with @RabbitListener(queues = "order.queue").

Parsed message (JSON or POJO).

Simulated stock check logic and logged outcome.

Professional Emphasis:
In interviews, stress idempotency, error handling, and retry mechanisms for message consumers.

8) OrderService Microservice – Configure Email Queue and Its Binding:- 
Objective:
Enable OrderService to emit a separate message to an email.queue for notification.

Implementation:

Added a second Queue, Binding, and routing key (e.g., email.routing.key) in OrderService.

Ensured this queue is bound to the same or a separate exchange.

Rationale:
Demonstrates multi-routing from a single producer, supporting event fan-out.

9) OrderService Microservice – Sending Event to Email Queue:- 
Objective:
Emit an additional event to the email.queue when an order is placed.

Steps:

Modified the producer to send two messages:

One to order.queue

One to email.queue (email routing key)

Used a dedicated method or overloaded producer class.

Professional Insight:
Supports cross-cutting concerns (like notification) in an asynchronous, loosely-coupled fashion.

10) EmailService Microservice – Configure RabbitMQ and Create RabbitMQ Consumer:- 
Objective:
Consume messages from email.queue and simulate email sending.

Implementation:

Configured RabbitMQ properties and defined email.queue bean.

Used @RabbitListener(queues = "email.queue") to receive message.

Logged or mocked email logic (e.g., sendEmail(order.getEmail())).

Best Practice:
Keeps messaging concerns modular and side-effect operations isolated from core logic.

11) Run 3 Microservices and Have a Demo:- 
Objective:
Demonstrate the full end-to-end workflow across three services.

Demo Flow:

Start RabbitMQ broker and all services.

POST order to /api/orders in OrderService.

Verify:

StockService consumes message → logs stock update.

EmailService consumes message → logs email sent.

Messages are routed to correct queues as per bindings.

Result:
Validates correct implementation of event-driven microservices using RabbitMQ, Spring Boot, and REST APIs.

Summary:
This project illustrates a complete, production-like microservices architecture using Spring Boot and RabbitMQ. It demonstrates proficiency in configuring RabbitMQ, producing/consuming events, handling JSON payloads, and creating REST interfaces. The design supports decoupling, scalability, and reliability — crucial principles for enterprise-grade distributed systems.
